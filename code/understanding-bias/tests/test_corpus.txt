farming in ancient egyptflax farming is growing crops or keeping animals by people for food and raw materials farming is part of agriculture history agriculture started thousands of years ago but no one knows for sure how old it is the development of farming gave rise to the neolithic revolution whereby people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in what became cities agriculture and domestication probably started in the fertile crescent the nile valley the levant and mesopotamia the area called fertile crescent is now in the countries of iraq syria turkey jordan lebanon israel and egypt wheat and barley are some of the first crops people grew people probably started agriculture slowly by planting few crops but still gathered many foods from the wild people may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change farming can feed many more people than hunter gatherers can feed on the same amount of land kinds of farming agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals but also growing other things like flowers and nursery plants manure or dung animal hides skins or furs leather animals fungi fibers cotton wool hemp and flax biofuels and drugs marijuana opium many people still live by subsistence agriculture on small farm they can only grow enough food to feed the farmer his family and his animals extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow the yield is the amount of food grown on given amount of land and it is often low this is because subsistence farmers are generally less educated and they have less money to buy equipment drought and other problems sometimes cause famines where yields are low deforestation can provide new land to grow more food this provides more nutrition for the farmer family but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years in rich countries farms are often fewer and larger during the th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better varieties of plants use more fertilizer use more water and more easily control weeds and pests many farms also use machines so fewer people can farm more land there are fewer farmers in rich countries but the farmers are able to grow more this kind of intensive agriculture comes with its own set of problems farmers use lot of chemical fertilizers pesticides chemicals that kill bugs and herbicides chemicals that kill weeds these chemicals can pollute the soil or the water they can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals causing outbreaks of these pests the soil can be damaged by erosion blowing or washing away salt buildup or loss of structure irrigation adding water from rivers can pollute water and lower the water table these problems have all got solutions and modern young farmers usually have good technical education agriculture techniques fertilizers crop rotation weed removal breeding fencing ranching plantation farmers select plants with better yield taste and nutritional value they also choose plants that can survive plant disease and drought and are easier to harvest centuries of artificial selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants the crops produce better yield with other techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control irrigation some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries and genetically modify these plants to improve them they then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries new plants were created with genetic engineering one example of genetic engineering is modifying plant to resist herbicide food it is important for there to be enough food for everyone the food must also be safe and good people say it is

of the world many millions of years ago because of this many animals and plants live in australia that do not live anywhere else these include animals like the kangaroo the koala the emu the kookaburra and the platypus people first arrived in australia more than years ago these native australians are called the australian aborigines for the history of australia see history of australia most of the australian colonies having been settled from britain became mostly independent democratic states in the and all six combined as federation on january the first prime minister of australia was edmund barton in australia is member of the united nations and the commonwealth of nations it is parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy with elizabeth ii as queen of australia and head of state and governor general who is chosen by the prime minister to carry out all the duties of the queen in australia regions and cities australia has six states two major mainland territories

and adelaide the largest inland city is canberra which is also the nation capital the largest city is sydney australia is very big country but much of the land is very dry and the middle of the continent is mostly desert only the areas around the east west and south coast have enough rain and suitable climate not too hot for many farms and cities history aboriginal people photograph of arrernte men of central australia in corroboree in the australian aboriginal people arrived in australia about years ago or even earlier until the arrival of british settlers in the aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land they lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways an example of aboriginal land management was the cumberland plain where sydney is now every few years the aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees this meant that lot of grass grew back but not many big trees kangaroos like to live on grassy plains but not in forests the kangaroos that lived on the plain were good food supply for the aboriginal people sometimes aborigines would name person after an animal and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population aboriginal people did not usually build houses except huts of grass leaves and bark they did not usually build walls or fences and there were no horses cows or sheep in australia that needed to be kept in pens the only aboriginal buildings that are known are fish traps made from stones piled up in the river and the remains of few stone huts in victoria and tasmania the aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth in some parts of australia the people used sharp flaked stone spearheads but most aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood australia has lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making the boomerang was used in some areas for sport and for hunting the aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them they believed that they had grown from the land so it was like their mother and they belonged to the land terra australis in the dutch merchants traded with the islands of batavia now indonesia to the north of australia and several different dutch ships touched on the coast of australia the dutch governor van diemen sent abel tasman on voyage of discovery and he found tasmania which he named van diemen land its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it the british government was sure that there must be very large land in the south that had not been explored they sent captain james cook to the pacific ocean his ship hms endeavour carried the famous scientists sir joseph banks and dr solander who were going to tahiti where they would watch the planet venus pass in front of the sun captain cook secret mission was to find terra australis the land of the south the voyage of discovery was very successful because they found new zealand and sailed right around it then they sailed westward at last boy william hicks who was up the mast spotted land on the horizon captain cook named that bit of land point hicks they sailed up the coast and captain cook named the land that he saw new south wales at last they sailed into large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food joseph banks and dr solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were they collected hundreds of plants to take back to england captain cook saw the aboriginal people with their simple way of life he saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit but there were no houses and no fences in most parts of the world people put up house and fence or some marker to show that they own the land but the aboriginal people did not own the land in that way they belonged to the land like baby belongs to its mother captain cook went home to england and told the government that no one owned the land this would later cause terrible problem for the aboriginal people settlement captain arthur phillip raises the british flag at sydney in in the in england laws were tough many people were poor and gaols jails were full person could be sentenced to death for stealing loaf of bread many people were hung for small crimes but usually they were just thrown in gaol often they were sent away to the british colonies in america but by the the colonies in america became the united states they were free from british rule and would not take england convicts any more so england needed to find new and less populated place by the the gaols of england were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships the government decided to make settlement in new south wales and send some of the convicts there in the first fleet of eleven ships set sail from portsmouth carrying convicts sailors marines few free settlers and enough food to last for two years their leader was captain arthur phillip they were to make new colony at the place that captain cook had discovered named botany bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists captain phillip found that botany bay was flat and windy there was not much fresh water he went with two ships up the coast and sailed into great harbor which he said was the finest harbor in the world there were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on on january the flag was raised and new south wales was claimed in the name of king george iii of england and the new settlement was called sydney for the first few years of the settlement things were very difficult no one in the british government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make new colony nobody had chosen them carefully there was only one man who was farmer there was no one among the convicts who was builder brick maker or blacksmith no one knew how to fix the tools when they broke all of the cattle escaped there were no cooking pots all the plants were different so no one knew which ones could be eaten it was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation somehow the little group of tents with hut for the governor arthur phillip and another hut for the supply of food grew into small town with streets bridge over the stream windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships by the there was fine brick house for the governor there was also hospital and convict barracks and beautiful church which are still standing today settlements had spread out from sydney firstly to norfolk island and to van diemen land tasmania and also up the coast to newcastle where coal was discovered and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to large herd spanish merino sheep had been brought to sydney and by farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of england while the settlement was growing in new south wales it was also growing in tasmania the climate in tasmania was more like that in england and farmers found it easy to grow crops there exploration governor lachlan macquarie was the th governor of new south wales and one who though that australia could be rich and free place because australia is such very large land it was easy to think that it might be able to hold very large number of people in the early days of the colony great number of explorers went out searching for good land to settle on when the settlers looked west from sydney they saw range of mountains which they called the blue mountains they were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no one could find their way through them in gregory blaxland william lawson and year old called william charles wentworth crossed the blue mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming road was built and the governor lachlan macquarie founded the town of bathurst on the other side miles from sydney some people like captain charles sturt were sure that there must be sea in the middle of australia and set out to find it many of the explorers did not prepare very well or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year some died like burke and wills ludwig leichhardt got lost twice the second time he was never seen again major thomas mitchell was one of the most successful explorers he mapped the country as he went and his maps remained in use for more than years he travelled all the way to what is now western victoria and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there the henty brothers had come from tasmania had built themselves house had successful farm and fed the major and his men on roast lamb and wine self government the gold rushes of new south wales and victoria started in leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold the population grew across south east australia and made great wealth and industry by the gold rushes had made some poor people very rich the transportation of convicts to australia ended in the and and more changes came the people in australia wanted to run their own country and not be told what to do from london the first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by london soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy william wentworth started the australian patriotic association australia first political party in to demand democratic government in the city councils started and some people could vote new south wales legislative council had its first elections in again with some limits on who could vote in limited self government was given by london to new south wales victoria south australia and tasmania in the right to vote was given to all men over in south australia the other colonies soon followed women were given the vote in the parliament of south australia in and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the

the drinks apple juice and cider usually cider contains little alcohol about as much as beer the regions of brittany in france and cornwall in england are known for their apple ciders apple cultivars if one wants to grow certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting seed from the wanted type the seed will have dna from the apple that the seeds came from but it will also have dna from the apple flower that pollinated the seeds which may well be different type this means that the tree which would grow from planting would be mixture of two in order to grow certain type of apple small twig or scion is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired and then added on to specially grown stump called rootstock the tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed there are more than known cultivars of apples different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates one large collection of over apple cultivars is at the national fruit collection in england most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh dessert apples however some are grown simply for cooking or making cider cider apples are usually too tart to eat immediately however they give cider rich flavor that dessert apples cannot most popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp colorful skin easy shipping disease resistance red delicious apple shape and popular flavor are also needed modern apples are usually sweeter than older cultivars this is because popular tastes in apples have become different most north americans and europeans enjoy sweet apples extremely sweet apples with hardly any acid taste are popular in asia and india in the united kingdom in the united kingdom there are about different types of apples the most common apple type grown in england is the bramley seedling which is popular cooking apple apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early when apples were rarely brought in from other countries organizations such as common ground teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit apple day is celebrated each october in many countries in north america many apples are grown in temperate parts of the united states and canada in many areas where apple growing is important people have huge celebrations annapolis valley apple blossom festival held five days every spring may june in nova scotia shenandoah apple blossom festival held six days every spring in winchester virginia washington state apple blossom festival held two weeks every spring april may in wenatchee washington varieties of apples

algebra is part of mathematics often called math in the united states and maths or numeracy in the united kingdom it uses variables to represent value that is not yet known when an equals sign is used this is called an equation very simple equation using variable is in this example or it could also be said equals five this is called solving for besides equations there are inequalities less than and greater than special type of equation is called the function this is often used in making graphs algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things physics engineering and computer programming are areas that use algebra all the time it is also useful to know in surveying construction and business especially accounting people who do algebra need to know the rules of numbers and mathematic operations used on numbers starting with adding subtracting multiplying and dividing more advanced operations involve exponents starting with squares and square roots interestingly many of these rules can also be used on the variables algebra was first used to solve equations and inequalities two examples are linear equations the equation of line mx and quadratic equations which has variables that are squared power of two number that is multiplied by itself for example how to factor polynomials is needed for quadratic equations history early forms of algebra were developed by the babylonians and the greeks however the word algebra is latin form of the arabic word al jabr casting and comes from mathematics book al maqala fi hisab al jabr wa al muqabilah essay on the computation of casting and equation written in the th century by persian mathematician muhammad ibn mūsā al khwārizmī who was muslim born in khwarizm in uzbekistan he flourished under al ma moun in baghdad iraq through ad and died around ad the book was brought into europe and translated into latin in the th century the book was then given the name algebra the ending of the mathematician name al khwarizmi was changed into word easier to say in latin and became the english word algorithm examples here is simple example of an algebra problem sue has candies ann has candies they decide to share so that they have the same number of candies these are the steps you can use to solve the problem to have the same number of candies ann has to give some to sue let represent the number of candies ann gives to sue sue candies plus must be the same as ann candies minus this is written as subtract from both sides of the equation this gives what happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too for the equation to still be true so in this case when was subtracted from both sides there was middle step of after person is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down add to both sides of the equation this gives divide both sides of the equation by this gives the answer is six if ann gives sue candies they will have the same number of candies to check this put back into the original equation wherever was this gives which is true they both now have candies with practice algebra can be used when faced with problem that is too hard to solve any other way problems such as building freeway designing cell phone or finding the cure for disease all require algebra writing algebra as in most parts of mathematics adding to or plus is written as subtracting from or minus is written as dividing by or over is written as or is more commonly used in algebra multiplying by or times can be written in ways or just yz the multiplication symbol is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter which is often used as variable also when multiplying larger expression parentheses can be used when we multiply number and letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter when the number is then the is not written because times any number is that number and so it is not needed functions and graphs linear equation for an important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve function is like box you can put number or numbers into and get certain number out when using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations graph is picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables the graph is often line and if the line does not bend or go straight up and down it can be described by the basic formula mx the variable is the intercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and is the slope or steepness of the line this formula applies to the coordinates of graph where each point on the line is written in some math problems like the equation for line there can be more than one variable and in this case to find points on the line one variable is changed the variable that is changed is called the independent variable then the math is done to make number the number that is made is called the dependent variable most of the time the independent variable is written as and the dependent variable is written as for example in this is often put on graph using an axis going left and right and axis going up and down it can also be written in function form so in this example we could put in for and get put in for would get and for would get so there would be line going thru the points and as seen in the graph to the right if has power of it is straight line if it is squared or some other power it will be curved if it uses an inequality then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line rules of algebra in algebra there are few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations these are called the rules of algebra while these rules may seem senseless or obvious it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics therefore it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted before going on to the rules reflect on two definitions that will be given opposite the opposite of is reciprocal the reciprocal of is rules commutative property of addition commutative means that function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around in other words the order of the terms in an equation do not matter when the operator of two terms is an addition the commutative property of addition is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for subtraction commutative property of multiplication when the operator of two terms is an multiplication the commutative property of multiplication is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for division when associative property of addition associative refers to the grouping of numbers the associative property of addition implies that when adding three or more terms it doesn matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for subtraction see the distributive property associative property of multiplication the associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or more terms it doesn matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for division distributive property the distributive property states that the multiplication of number by another term can be distributed for instance do not confuse this with the associative properties for instance additive identity property identity refers to the property of number that it is equal to itself in other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum the additive identity property states that the sum of any number and is that number this also holds for subtraction multiplicative identity property the multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and is that number this also holds for division additive inverse property the additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property when an operation is the sum of number and its opposite and it equals that operation is valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following additive inverse of is multiplicative inverse property the multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of number and its reciprocal and it equals that operation is valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following multiplicative inverse of is advanced algebra in addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra this includes how to use matrix to solve many linear equations at once abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations going beyond numbers to the more abstract with groups of numbers many math problems are about physics and engineering in many of these physics problems time is variable time uses the letter using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems energy is force is mass is acceleration is and speed of light is sometimes this is used in some famous equations like ma and mc although more complex math beyond algebra was needed

atom drawing of lithium atom in the middle is the nucleus which in this case has four neutrons blue and three protons red orbiting it are its three electrons lithium atom model showing nucleus with four neutrons blue three protons red and orbited by three electrons black classification smallest recognised division of chemical element properties mass to kg electric charge zero an atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter there are many different types of atoms each with its own name mass and size these different atoms are called chemical elements the chemical elements are organized on the periodic table examples of elements are hydrogen and gold atoms are very small but the exact size changes depending on the element atoms range from to nanometers in width one nanometer is about times smaller than the width of human hair this makes atoms impossible to see without special tools equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms atoms join together to make molecules for example two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom combine to make water molecule when atoms join together it is called chemical reaction every atom is made up of three kinds of smaller particles called protons which are positively charged neutrons which have no charge and electrons which are negatively charged the protons and neutrons are heavier and stay in the middle of the atom they are called the nucleus they are surrounded by cloud of electrons which are very light in weight and are attracted to the positive charge of the nucleus this attraction is called electromagnetic force the number of protons neutrons and electrons an atom has tells us what element it is hydrogen for example has one proton no neutrons and one electron the element sulfur has protons neutrons and electrons the number of protons is the atomic number the number of protons and neutrons together is the atomic weight atoms move faster when they are in gas form because they are free to move than they do in liquid form and solid matter in solid materials the atoms are tightly packed next to each other so they vibrate but are not able to move there is no room as atoms in liquids do history the word atom comes from the greek ἀτόμος atomos indivisible from not and τόμος cut the first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the greek philosopher democritus around bc atomic theory stayed as mostly philosophical subject with not much actual scientific investigation or study until the development of chemistry in the in french chemist antoine lavoisier defined the term element for the first time he said that an element was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry any substance that could be broken down was compound in english philosopher john dalton suggested that elements were tiny solid balls made of atoms dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass he said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine according to dalton in certain compound the atoms of the compound elements always combine the same way in british scientist robert brown looked at pollen grains in water under his microscope the pollen grains appeared to be jiggling brown used dalton atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved this was called brownian motion in albert einstein used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were caused by the reactions of atoms and by doing this he conclusively proved the existence of the atom in scientist dmitri mendeleev published the first version of the periodic table the periodic table groups elements by their atomic number how many protons they have this is usually the same as the number of electrons elements in the same column or period usually have similar properties for example helium neon argon krypton and xenon are all in the same column and have very similar properties all these elements are gases that have no colour and no smell also they are unable to combine with other atoms to form compounds together they are known as the noble gases the physicist thomson was the first person to discover electrons this happened while he was working with cathode rays in he realized they had negative charge unlike protons positive and neutrons no charge thomson created the plum pudding model which stated that an atom was like plum pudding the dried fruit electrons were stuck in mass of pudding protons in scientist named ernest rutherford used the geiger marsden experiment to prove that most of an atom is in very small space called the atomic nucleus rutherford took photo plate and covered it with gold foil and then shot alpha particles made of two protons and two neutrons stuck together at it many of the particles went through the gold foil which proved that atoms are mostly empty space electrons are so small they make up only of an atom mass ernest rutherford in niels bohr introduced the bohr model this model showed that electrons travel around the nucleus in fixed circular orbits this was more accurate than the rutherford model however it was still not completely right improvements to the bohr model have been made since it was first introduced in chemist frederick soddy found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom for example any atom with protons should be helium atom usually helium nucleus also contains two neutrons however some helium atoms have only one neutron this means they truly are helium because an element is defined by the number of protons but they are not normal helium either soddy called an atom like this with different number of neutrons an isotope to get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its nucleus and add this to the name of the element so helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium and carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon however when he developed his theory soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed to prove they were real physicist james chadwick and team of others created the mass spectrometer the mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms by doing this chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom neutrons must exist in german chemist otto hahn became the first person to create nuclear fission in laboratory he discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at uranium atom hoping to create new isotope however he noticed that instead of new isotope the uranium simply changed into barium atom smaller atom than uranium apparently hahn had broken the uranium atom this was the world first recorded nuclear fission reaction this discovery eventually led to the creation of the atomic bomb further into the th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom using particle accelerators they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles called quarks the most accurate model so far comes from the schrödinger equation schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in cloud around the nucleus called the electron cloud in the electron cloud it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are the schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be this area is called the electron orbital structure and parts parts helium atom with the nucleus shown in red and enlarged embeded in cloud of electrons the complex atom is made up of three main particles the proton the neutron and the electron the isotope of hydrogen hydrogen has no neutrons just the one proton and one electron positive hydrogen ion has no electrons just the one proton and one neutron these two examples are the only known exceptions to the rule that all other atoms have at least one proton one neutron and one electron each electrons are by far the smallest of the three atomic particles their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology they have negative charge protons and neutrons are of similar size and weight to each other protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge most atoms have neutral charge because the number of protons positive and electrons negative are the same the charges balance out to zero however in ions different number of electrons this is not always the case and they can have positive or negative charge protons and neutrons are made out of quarks of two types up quarks and down quarks proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark nucleus the nucleus is in the middle of an atom it is made up of protons and neutrons usually in nature two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other so for long time it was mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together they solved this by finding particle called gluon its name comes from the word glue as gluons act like atomic glue sticking the protons together using the strong nuclear force it is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons diagram showing the main difficulty in nuclear fusion the fact that protons which have positive charges repel each other when forced together the number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through radioactive decay when there are too many neutrons or protons the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles it does this by emitting radiation in the form of alpha beta or gamma decay nuclei can change through other means too nuclear fission is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei releasing lot of stored energy this release of energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making bombs and electricity in the form of nuclear power the other way nuclei can change is through nuclear fusion when two nuclei join together or fuse to make heavier nucleus this process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons as they have the same charge such high energies are most common in stars like our sun which fuses hydrogen for fuel electrons electrons orbit or travel around the nucleus they are called the atom electron cloud they are attracted towards the nucleus because of the electromagnetic force electrons have negative charge and the nucleus always has positive charge so they attract each other around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others in different layers these are called electron shells in most atoms the first shell has two electrons and all after that have eight exceptions are rare but they do happen and are difficult to predict the further away the electron is from the nucleus the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it this is why bigger atoms with more electrons react more easily with other atoms the of the nucleus is not strong enough to hold onto their electrons and atoms lose electrons to the strong attraction of smaller atoms radioactive decay some elements and many isotopes have what is called an unstable nucleus this means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together or has too many protons or neutrons when this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles it does this through radiation an atom that does this can be called radioactive unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass particles that they become stable all atoms above atomic number protons lead are radioactive there are three main types of radioactive decay alpha beta and gamma alpha decay is when the atom shoots out particle having two protons and two neutrons this is essentially helium nucleus the result is an element with atomic number two less than before so for example if beryllium atom atomic number went through alpha decay it would become helium atomic number alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass beta decay is when neutron turns into proton or proton turns into neutron in the first case the atom shoots out an electron in the second case it is positron like an electron but with positive charge the end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons or too many neutrons gamma decay is when an atom shoots out gamma ray or wave it happens when there is change in the energy of the nucleus this is usually after nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay there is no change in the mass or atomic number or the atom only in the stored energy inside the nucleus every radioactive element or isotope has what is named half life this is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become different stable isotope or element large atoms or isotopes with big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have long half life because they must lose more neutrons to become stable marie curie discovered the first form of radiation she found the element and named it radium she was also the first female recipient of the nobel prize frederick soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays he placed sample in light bulb and waited for it to decay suddenly helium containing protons and neutrons appeared in the bulb and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has positive charge james chadwick discovered the neutron by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom he concluded that electrons could not be the cause of the extra mass because they barely have mass enrico fermi used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium he discovered that uranium decayed lot faster than usual and produced lot of alpha and beta particles he also believed that uranium got changed into new element he named hesperium otto hanh and fritz strassmann repeated fermi experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created they discovered two new things fermi did not observe by using lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split producing lot of heat energy also the fission products of uranium were already discovered thorium palladium radium radon and lead fermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom shot off more neutrons which then split other atoms creating chain reactions he realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create huge amounts of heat energy that very discovery of fermi led to the development of the first nuclear bomb code named trinity references other websites general information on atomic structure atomic

th century map of the sky astronomy is natural science it is the study of everything outside the atmosphere of earth it studies celestial objects such as stars galaxies planets moons asteroids comets and nebulae and processes such as supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation this includes the physics chemistry of those objects and processes the word astronomy comes from the greek words astron which means star and nomos which means law person who studies astronomy is called an astronomer astronomy is one of the oldest sciences ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate and to find when was the best time to plant crops astronomy is very similar to astrophysics related subject physical cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as whole and the way the universe changed over time astronomy is not the same as astrology the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect human lives since the th century there have been two main types of astronomy observational and theoretical astronomy observational astronomy uses telescopes and cameras to observe or look at stars galaxies and other astronomical objects theoretical astronomy uses maths and computer models to predict what should happen the two often work together the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works history of astronomy ancient early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars they used maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe for long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it this is known as geocentrism ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is sphere theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around it this is known as heliocentrism only few people thought it was right the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars come from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth they also learned from the ancients by translating greek books into arabic renaissance to modern era drawings of the moon by galileo his drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used telescope to look at the moon during the renaissance priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything based on previous works he said that the earth was planet and all the planets moved around the sun this brought back the old idea of heliocentrism physicist called galileo galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time he agreed with copernicus the catholic church decided that galileo was wrong he had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest heliocentric ideas were soon improved by johannes kepler and isaac newton who invented the theory of gravity after galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets uranus and neptune they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in range of colours and sizes they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae modern era the th century saw important changes in astronomy in karl jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to isolate source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made the opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source the period after world war saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world similarly the end of the saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii good site for visible and infra red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere the rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made from satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are things in the universe whether it is planet like our earth or galaxy like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe bodies for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies solar planets asteroids comets galactic stars diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarves neutron stars black holes cosmic galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters phenomena burst events are those where there is sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing burst of energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that happen regularly in repetitive way the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for wave to complete one cycle periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened long time ago the signal from these events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background radiation methods instruments telescopes are the main tool of observing they take all the light in big area and put in into small area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories techniques there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens light from distant source reaches sensor and gets measured normally by human eye or camera for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen one technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background until it can be seen telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement aperture synthesis with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes adaptive optics adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better data analysis data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it the observation is first stored as data this data will then have various techniques used to analyse it fourier analysis fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over length of time is changing periodically changes like wave if so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets fields good example of fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be similar to some but not all of type of bright source in rays called low mass ray binary it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them it should be noted that astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing fields by body solar astronomy solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away it is the easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate on earth stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun the solar wind hitting the earth magnetic field causes the northern lights studying the sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works planetary astronomy planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassini huygens saturn and the voyager and galactic astronomy galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations fields by electromagnetic spectrum radio astronomy radio telescope mhd hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars this makes mhd an important and useful tool in astronomy other fields gravitational wave astronomy gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum so far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been very limited related pages solar system planet satellite natural

such as garage or large designs such as whole city architecture often overlaps with civil engineering and architects and civil engineers often work together history romanesque groin vault in the past people built huts and wood houses to protect themselves from the weather for safety they were often close together great civilizations like the ancient egyptians built large temples and structures like the great pyramids of giza the ancient greeks and romans made what we now call classical architecture the romans working over years ago copied the arch from the etruscans who copied it from the mesopotamians the stone columns which still hold up so many important buildings like the parthenon in athens were simply copied from the first wooden posts simpler building in hungary classical architecture was very formal and it always obeyed laws it used symmetry which really means balance and it used proportion which means keeping shapes in certain ways the golden mean was rule or law which said to put it very simply if you are making room or any other thing it will work best if you always make the long side times longer than the short side there are many laws in classical architecture like how high the middle of an arched bridge needs to be which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be these laws were learned from thousands of years of experience and they are as true today as they were years ago in some parts of the world like india the architecture is famous for carving the stone on temples and palaces different architectural styles were made in china japan southeast asia africa mexico and central and south america later people in western europe in the middle ages made romanesque architecture then gothic architecture gothic buildings have tall pointed windows and arches many churches have gothic architecture castles were also built at this time in eastern europe churches usually had domes people added their own ideas and decoration to the classical architecture of the past the renaissance brought return to classical ideas architecture can have many styles such as the curved guggenheim museum in new york city in the late th century with the industrial revolution people began to invent machines to make things quickly and cheaply many factories and mills were built during or after this revolution decades later in the victorian era architects like george fowler jones and decimus burton still followed the gothic style to build new churches up to this point buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and masonry used to construct them gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller for example the cathedral in ulm germany is over feet tall however building with stone has its limits and building too tall could result in collapse this happened to the beauvais cathedral which was never completed new technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the willis tower in chicago towards the end of the th century with second industrial revolution steel became much cheaper architects began to use inventions like metal girders and reinforced concrete to build an example is the eiffel tower in paris buildings can now be built taller than ever before we call them skyscrapers this new technology has made us free from traditional limitations and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated replaced or abandoned cheap strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls especially for office buildings modernism is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies and its beginnings can been seen as early as modernism can also refer to specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late th century and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then which are sometimes called post modern many of the world greatest structures were built by modern day architects such as frank lloyd wright
